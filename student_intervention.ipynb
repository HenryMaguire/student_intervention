    "**Answer: ** I would choose support vector machines to classify the students. This is because on average it has a higher and more consistent F1 score on the test set, suggesting it is likely to be more reliable than the other two methods. One drawback is that the training time is much longer and seems to be increasing at a faster rate with respect to training set size than Naive Bayes, however this won't be a problem since it is increasing linearly and we only need to train the model once or twice a year. The prediction time is not scaling too badly either and making predictions for thousands of students will at most take only a few seconds. \n",

    "Gassian Naive Bayes is performing well and seems to be consistently improving with more datapoints. It is also remarkably efficient, with good scaling to number of datapoints. I feel like the assumption of uncorrelated features is likely to be too strong though and may not be valid for our school data (study_time, activities, free_time). It also slightly underperforms compared to SVM. The Random trees model is clearly the worst, since it has a very high F1 training score with a lower test score, suggesting overfitting to noise in the dataset. It also take a lot longer to train than both of the others."

    "**Answer: ** Support vector machines attempts to find the category for datapoints based on a number of key attributes. In our case this would be predicting the success or failure of a student based on data such as the amount of time they study, health, age. The various ways that these attributes interact can make it very hard to predict the success of a student, but SVM can help us get around this. In the case of two categories (e.g. success or failure), the method finds the position of a boundary line which makes a clear cut between the two different groups based on a set of training data, of which the categories are already known. In our case, we can use historical data of students from previous years, in order to build a predictive model for the performance of current students. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way Support Vector Machines finds the best position for a boundary line is by making sure the \"distance\" between the line and datapoints of one category is as large as possible, whilst also being as far as possible to points in the other category. The really powerful advantage of support vector machines is that it allows us to not only find straight boundaries which separate datapoints of different groups, but also far more complex lines which can suit our particular problem. This flexibility comes down to the way we define the \"distance\" between the boundary and the datapoints. Also, SVM can be used to categorise data to more than just two groups as in our example. "
